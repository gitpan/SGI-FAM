* magicrcs

Reorganize options docs. Test on more situations. Warn vs. die more often
(e.g. on tmpfile create & delete before checkin can occur?). Figure out how to
really redirect STDERR away, and maybe pick up those messages on syslog?
Multi-level verbosity. Default log author to file owner.

* Interface
Provide a higher-level interface. E.g.:

use SGI::FAM::Higher qw(wait_create);
wait_create {
  my $new=shift;
  ...
} 'dir1', 'dir2';

* XSUB
Clean up a bit on the FAMEventPtr->fc and ->fr methods? Try the P5P method for
blessing the pointers in the desired fashion; random typemap tweaks.

* Selects
Provide ability to mindlessly select on the FAM file descriptor and provide
appropriate handlers for the resultant signals, using callbacks.

* Insulation
Removing some low-level constraints.

** Pathnames
Use rel2abs where necessary.

** Moves
Provide mechanism for detecting moves. I.e., if a create or delete is
registered, note filesystem/inode and wait for the other. (Seems to be create
then delete, as expected, but could be munged due to asynchronous
notification.)

** Auto-monitor files in dir
To check for execution, I guess; that seems to be the only unmonitored thing.

** Exist events
Cause them to be suitably removed from view, unless some purpose can be
demonstrated. Ditto for ack events.

** Changes
Use fstat, MD5, &c. to determine the exact change.

** Suspended diffs
Some mechanism to explicitly poll after a resumption.
